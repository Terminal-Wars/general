Nothing to see here, other then a few things that don't really need their own repo.
The highlight here is the issues tab, where a general todo list for TerminalWars is present and suggestions for the general project can be made.

[Some things from the old issues page should also be moved here](https://github.com/Terminal-Wars/TerminalWars/issues)
