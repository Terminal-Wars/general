# Potential names for things

As a result of the fact that I (IoI_xD) am probably gonna be the only one working on this for awhile, I've decided to name most of the things used internally in Terminal Wars off of albums, songs, and bands I like.

This is a list of names I haven't used yet, and it will be updated as I use them or find new albums I like (that would actually ring and sound good).

* Orion
* 4x4
* MidManhattan
* Kauai
* GalacticFunk
* MintJams
* Asayake
* DominoLine
* Swear
* SweetMagic
* SpaceRoad
* RainbowGoblin
* SeaLine
* 52ndStreet
